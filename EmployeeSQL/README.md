# SQL CHALLENGE
The instructions were followed and the 3 parts of the challenge completed as follows:
1. Data Modeling: please see the Excel file: 'QuickDBD_sql_challenge_CZ' that shows the image of the Entity Relationship Diagram.
2. Data Engineering:  Please see the txt file 'schema_solution_sql_challenge_CZ' which shows the code used to create the relationsihps, primary and foreign keys and the data types.  Also, please see the SQL file 'schema_solution_sql_challenge_CZ' which shows the query that created the tables.
3. Data Analysis: Please see the SQL queries, for each activity, in the SQL file 'sql_challenge_data_analysis_CZ'.  Also, please see the folder 'Data Analysis Results', which contains the CSV files created for each activity of the challenge.

One thing to note is that I had to change the date format of the 'employees' file to match the PostgreSQL date format: YYYY-MM-DD.
